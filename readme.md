#Work in Progress!!!

This is part of a wider project to build out demo environments quickly and as code

In this folder you will find the plan when it comes to deploying Veeam components to a given platform.

As of writing this Veeam Backup & Replication and Veeam ONE both require to be ran on the Windows OS, this code will build out Windows base VMs on these platforms and then if you choose to it can also deploy Veeam via Ansible Playbooks which can be found on VeeamHUB.

This is a commiunity project with community support.
